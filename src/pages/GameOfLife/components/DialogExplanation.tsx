        <h3>Game of Life Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular
          automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

          This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article
          published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a grid of
          cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or
          multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various
          patterns throughout the course of the game.
